# Choochoobot

These scripts power the social media choochoobot, the trains-botting friend we all know and love, on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/choochoo.xor.blue) and [Mastodon](https://tech.intersects.art/@choochoo/). Trains are created with real-time weather and moon phase support, using [observations from a weather station in Central Park](https://parkerhiggins.net/2017/09/pulling-free-and-open-weather-data-in-python/) and the Python library [Astral](https://astral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), respectively.

This code is released under a free software license and you are welcome to fork it and generate trains to your heart's content. I'm well aware that it's a goofy little thing, but because this is a personal creative project I will probabl not accept pull requests or issues about anything other than its technical operation.
